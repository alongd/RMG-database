name = "Sulfur/H2S+S=2SH_1bar"
shortDesc = u"H2S + S = SH + SH at 1bar"
longDesc =u"""
The H2S + S = SH + SH reaction has several pathways.
The direct H-abstraction on the triplet surface has a barrier of 45 kJ/mol
H2S + S can also pass through an inter-system crossing (barrier estimated to be only 3 kJ/mol),
passing through singlet H2SS and HSSH, yielding the same products (SH + SH).
The direct H-abvstraction is significant above 800 K, and dominates above 1000 K.
However, below 700-800 K this reaction is significantly dependent on pressure. 
This reaction should be modeled as two duplicate reactions - Arhennius and PDep.
However, the PDep path is only givin in literature at 1 bar.
This reaction behaves as P-Dep at low P, while its high-P limit is zero(!).
This library should not be used at higher pressures.
