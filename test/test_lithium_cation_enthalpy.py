Unit tests for I-129: the lithium cation's enthalpy of formation in LithiumPrimaryThermo.

The report is ``docs/i129-lithium-cation-enthalpy.md``. This file is the executable half
of it. Every number the report quotes that can be re-derived is re-derived here, so a
later change that moves one fails a test rather than silently contradicting a document.

The defect, in one line: the shipped ``[Lip]`` sat 375.363 kJ/mol above ``[Li]`` where
lithium's ionisation energy is 520.221, and the entropy of the same pair was exactly
R ln 2 - enthalpy wrong, entropy right. The enthalpy has been replaced from NIST-JANAF
table Li-006.

Five groups:

1. **The corrected value against its source**, by the two independent conversion routes
   that carry JANAF's electron convention into this database's ion convention.
2. **The relationship that was wrong**, now asserted rather than assumed - including the
   1.73 kJ/mol residual that was deliberately left standing rather than tuned away.
3. **The diagnosis, as executable claims.** The correction chain is charge-blind; the
   BAC cannot reach a monatomic species; no lithium atom energy ships at any level of
   theory. These measurements show that the original number is inconsistent with the
   expected accuracy of the declared calculation, without asserting a universal
   impossibility from the finite-basis variational bound alone.
3. **What did not change** - the other 131 entries, and the entropy and heat capacity of
   ``[Lip]`` itself.
4. **The regeneration hazard**, because the failure mode this correction introduces is
   that someone re-runs ARC and silently reverts it. The library header has to keep
   saying so.

Run with the runtime pinned::

    cd <RMG-database checkout>
    PYTHONPATH=<RMG-Py checkout> \\
        <python> -m pytest test/test_lithium_cation_enthalpy.py -q

``test/conftest.py`` pins ``database.directory`` to this worktree before collection; the
fixtures below assert that pin rather than trusting it.
